Your father has a drawer that he doesnt let you touch for obvious reasons. 
But one day he says he says he has something special to show you. 
So he pulls out a see through mirror which makes you doubt what it could be used for.
Then he takes you to outside to show you what the normal looking glass can do. 
He holds the mirror up and his face brightens up.
It makes you wonder what it is.
He explains that this is a special mirror he developed that lets one see the stars. 
You question what does that even mean? Because you can already see a few stars, around 6.
Your dad laughs showing you through the glass and you become amazed at magnificent beauty of the night sky.
Your heart starts to pound hard and you keep looking at the sky for minutes.
It fills your heart to see something so amazing for the first time. 
You ask dad immediately when you get back to senses, what is this????
He explains that, the night sky holds a lot of beautiful night stars and cosmos for us to see.
But unfortunately, modern world has so much light pollution that we can barely see any stars.
It makes you feel guilty and you ask if there's anything you can do to change the current sky's condition.
Your father chuckles a bit and thinks something for a bit looking at the sky...
He looks at you saying, maybe, maybe not. We can do something about it but it has to be done by an effort of everyone in the world.
It's just not easy.
But there's a chance. Maybe you'll be the one to be able to do something about it. Haha. Sigh~
Anyways, He then gives you a astrology book showing a lot of stars and their shapes.
He tells you to have fun with them.
You then try to find the shapes in the sky.
....
The game now, I guess. Finding shapes in the sky.
